- improved coding consistency
- node* types and constants are more correctly vnode*
- initial and very temporary rendering code
- vnode.dom is drawing into DOM
- modified demo with simple hello world
- we have a renderable vnode!
- non-vnode elements can be wrapped as vnodes (useful for application containers like div#app)
