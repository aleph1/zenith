# _Zenith.js_

Zenith.js is a minimal view layer for building web interfaces. It is designed to be simple to use, while integrating with 3rd party libraries for state management and routing.

Hereâ€™s the first example to get you started. As you can see there is no build step required.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <script src="https://unpkg.com/zenith"></script>
    <script>
    </script>
  </head>
  <body>
    <main id="app"></main>
  </body>
</html>
```
