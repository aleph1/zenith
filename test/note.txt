Please do not use the test syntax as an approach to coding with Zenith!

The tests uses vNodes stored as const, as well as nested access to
children[*].children[*]..., which are both bad practice in the majority
of contexts. Writing the tests this way allows for slightly shorter code.

Refer to the documentation and examples for proper coding practices.
